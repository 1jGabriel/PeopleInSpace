# PeopleInSpace

Minimal **Kotlin Multiplatform** project using Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI

It makes use of basic API (http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) to show list of people currently in
space (inspired by https://kousenit.org/2019/12/19/a-few-astronomical-examples-in-kotlin/)!  The list is shown on Android
using **Jetpack Compose** and on iOS using **SwiftUI**
